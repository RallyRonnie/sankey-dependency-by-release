#Sankey Dependency by Release

Follows a release scoped dashboard or adds its own release picker.  

The sankey dependency by release only shows stories that are associated explicitly associated with the Release.

If an item has a predecessor that is not in the release, the predecessor will be displayed with a black bar (instead of the display color for the item or the default blue color for no display color).
If an item has a successor that is not in the release, the successor will not be displayed on the graph.
